## Catan

Inpiration: https://www.catan.com/

Purpose: Create a random board generator for the Settlers of Catan board game. 

Background: In the base game, there are four sheep, four wheat, four wood, three ore, three brick, and one desert. The Number tiles are 2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,8,8,9,9,10,10,11,11,12. Every tile will get a random number expect for the desert. Below are screen shots of the two seperate random board generators that I created. One was created using QTGui and the other was formulated in html. Both are python scripts with the same logic.
